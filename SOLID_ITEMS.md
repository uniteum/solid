Solid is a universally compatible Ethereum token with a uniquely powerful set of properties:
Trivial to create
Immediately tradeable
Bought, sold, and backed by native value
Growing demand and shrinking supply naturally push the price higher
Price cannot fall below starting price
The first buyer, typically the creator, cannot lose
Early participation is rewarded naturally
Everyone is treated fairly, and the rules cannot change
No exchange or operator is required
