Solid is a universally compatible Ethereum token with a uniquely powerful set of properties:
* Trivial to create
* Immediately tradeable
* Bought, sold, and backed by native value
* Growing demand and shrinking supply naturally push the price higher
* The price cannot fall below its starting price
* The first buyer, typically the creator, cannot lose
* Early participation is rewarded naturally
* Everyone is treated fairly, and the rules cannot change
* No exchange or operator is required
