# Uniteum 1

Uniteum 1 is a Solid token. Its name is "Uniteum 1" and its symbol is "1."

It was created using the same protocol that anyone can use to create their own token. There's nothing special about it mechanically — it follows the same rules as every other Solid. Same pool. Same curve. Same math.

What makes it different is what it represents.

## A way to support the protocol

Solid is open source, permissionless, and has no fees. There's no treasury, no token sale, and no venture funding. The protocol doesn't extract value from its users.

But building and maintaining it takes work.

Buying [1](https://etherscan.io/token/{{site.data.solids.1.address}}){:target="_blank"} is a simple, voluntary way to support that work. When you buy, your ETH goes into the token's pool — the same constant-product pool that every Solid uses. You get tokens. The pool gets liquidity.

There's no promise of returns. No governance rights. No special access. Just a straightforward signal that you find this project worth supporting.

## How it works

Like every Solid, Uniteum 1 has a built-in trading pool backed by ETH. You can:

- **Buy** — send ETH to receive 1 tokens
- **Sell** — return tokens to receive ETH
- **Hold** — keep them as long as you like

The price moves along a curve. Early supporters get more tokens per ETH. As more people buy, the price rises. If people sell, the price falls — but never below the floor set by the virtual reserve.

There's no lock-up, no vesting, no expiration. Your tokens are yours, and the pool is always open.

## Why not just accept donations?

A donation disappears into an address. You send ETH, it's gone, and there's no ongoing relationship between you and the project.

Uniteum 1 is different. Your support stays visible — as tokens in your wallet and as ETH in the pool. If you change your mind, you can sell back. If the project grows and more people buy in, your tokens are worth more than you paid. If it doesn't, the price floor means your tokens still have value.

It's not a donation. It's not an investment. It's somewhere in between — a way to put skin in the game without giving up control.
