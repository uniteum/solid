Solid is a protocol, not an application.

That means its value shows up less as a single “killer app” and more as a collection of simple mechanisms that can be composed into very different social and economic behaviors.

This section collects concrete, real-world use cases that fall naturally out of Solid’s design.

## Personal gift certificates

One of the simplest and most intuitive uses of Solid is as a **personal gift certificate**—issued by an individual, backed with real ETH, and redeemable at any time.

Unlike traditional gift cards, this mechanism:

- Requires the creator to *buy* the tokens they give away
- Guarantees continuous liquidity via on-chain math
- Encourages spending gently rather than enforcing expiration
- Carries the identity of the giver, not a corporation

The result is a gift that feels personal, honest, and surprisingly effective at being used.

## Game currencies

Games already run on currencies—not just gold or gems, but *life*, *energy*, *time*, *risk*, *reputation*, and *control*. These resources are scarce, spent, replenished, and priced against one another.

Solids provide a way to model these mechanics as explicit, composable currencies rather than hard-coded rules:

- Energy limits throughput and naturally throttles grinding
- Life becomes collateral for high-risk strategies
- Time can be accelerated at rising cost
- Reputation resists inflation through economic enforcement

Instead of asking "Is this balanced?", designers ask "Is this priced correctly?"

## More to come

Additional use cases will be added here, including:

- Time-limited social experiments
- Family or group allowances
- Bounties and coordination incentives
- Value instruments with no operator or issuer control

Each example focuses on *what emerges* from Solid's rules, rather than hypothetical features layered on top.

Solid doesn't prescribe behavior.
It makes certain behaviors natural.
