# A Personal Gift Certificate That Encourages Spending

Sometimes you want to give someone value without turning it into a chore.

Gift cards are supposed to be easy, but they have a way of becoming dead weight: forgotten balances, awkward redemption flows, and that faint sense that the “gift” is really just store credit with a logo on it.

So imagine a different kind of gift—one that is liquid, honest, and gently nudges the recipient to actually use it.

## The story of "Mara Credits"

Mara is the kind of person who likes gifts that feel personal. Not expensive for the sake of being expensive—just *thoughtful*. The problem is that thoughtful gifts often require guessing: the right brand, the right size, the right taste, the right day.

This year Mara decides to stop guessing.

Instead, she creates her own Solid token.

She names it whatever she wants. Today she chooses:

- Name: `Mara`
- Symbol: `CRED`

It's her signature on the gift. Not a corporation’s.

And she backs it with real ETH.

## No free tokens, not even for the creator

Here’s the part Mara likes most, because it keeps the whole thing honest:

Even though she *created* the token, she doesn’t get to hand out value for free.

Yes, the protocol allocates supply in a fixed, deterministic way at creation—but if Mara wants to distribute tokens as gifts, she has to acquire them by buying from the token’s own built-in pool like anyone else.

So Mara buys her own `CRED` tokens with ETH.

That purchase does two things at once:

1. It gives her tokens to gift.
2. It increases the ETH in the pool that backs redemptions for everyone.

In other words, the gift has real collateral because Mara actually paid for it.

## The gift is simple

Mara sends `CRED` tokens to friends and family.

There’s no enrollment.
No coupon code.
No account to create.

Just: “Here. This is yours.”

And her recipients don’t have to believe a story about future value. The value is there immediately, because the token can always be converted back to ETH through the same on-chain mechanism that created its price in the first place.

## The gentle nudge: spending is rewarded

Mara tells everyone one more thing:

> “If you redeem early, you get a slightly better conversion.”

Not because Mara controls anything—she doesn’t.
Not because there’s an expiration date—there isn’t.

It’s because the token’s pool follows a constant-product curve: as people redeem tokens for ETH, the pool shifts. Early redeemers get a better marginal rate than later redeemers.

And crucially, the incentive is *gentle*.

For amounts significantly less than the initial backing (say, much less than 1 ETH), the marginal price doesn’t move dramatically. A small redemption doesn’t blow out the rate for everyone else. It’s not punitive. It’s just a soft slope that makes “use it” feel slightly better than “wait forever.”

No cliff.
No panic.
No shame.

Just a nudge.

## Why this feels different than a gift card

A gift card says: “Spend this at a place.”

`CRED` says: “This came from a person.”

Even months later, when someone scrolls through their wallet, they don’t see a corporate brand and a forgotten balance. They see:

`CRED`

And they remember:

“Oh yeah—Mara gave me that.”

It’s a gift with identity.

## What makes it trustworthy

The nicest part is what Mara *cannot* do:

- She can’t freeze redemptions.
- She can’t change the rules.
- She can’t revoke anyone’s tokens.
- She can’t secretly redirect the pool.

The mechanism is the commitment.

So when someone redeems `CRED` for ETH, it doesn’t feel like asking permission. It feels like using a tool that was built to do exactly one thing, forever.

## A gift that behaves like physics

Mara’s little experiment produces a social effect that surprises her.

People actually spend it.

Not because they’re forced.
Not because it expires.
Not because they’re threatened with losing it.

But because the curve makes procrastination gently expensive—and immediacy gently rewarding.

It’s the opposite of most incentives.

It doesn’t scream.
It doesn’t punish.
It just makes action feel natural.

And the best part is that none of this relies on a company.

Just a name, a symbol, a pool, and math.
