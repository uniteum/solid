# Solids FAQ

## General Questions

**Q: Wait, I get ZERO tokens as the creator?**

A: Correct - you receive zero tokens automatically. However, you can buy at the initial price just like anyone else. Your advantage is being first, not getting free tokens or a special discount. It's a fair first-mover advantage.

**Q: Can I remove liquidity?**

A: No. 100% of tokens are permanently locked in the pool. The virtual 1 ETH creates an unremovable price floor. This is a feature - it prevents rugs.

**Q: What if someone else makes my token name?**

A: They can't "steal" it - the same name+symbol always produces the same address. Being first to create gives you the chance to buy at the initial price, which is the natural reward for taking initiative.

**Q: Can I make multiple Solids?**

A: Yes! It's completely free (just gas). Make as many as you want.

**Q: Should I send ETH when making a Solid?**

A: Only if you want to bootstrap initial liquidity for the community. The token works fine with 0 ETH (thanks to virtual pricing), but adding ETH immediately boosts the price.

**Q: Can I increase the ETH pool after making a token?**

A: Yes! Anyone can send ETH directly to the contract address. This permanently increases the price floor for all holders - pure altruism.

**Q: What blockchain is this on?**

A: Ethereum mainnet and major L2s (Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon).

**Q: Is this audited?**

A: The code uses battle-tested OpenZeppelin primitives and standard AMM math. Review the code yourself - it's less than 100 lines.

**Q: What's the catch?**

A: No catch. It's an experiment in pure public goods and permanent liquidity. The only "cost" is gas (~$1.50).

**Q: Can I use this for serious projects?**

A: The contracts are simple and secure, but do your own research. Start small, test thoroughly.

**Q: Is Solid open source?**

A: No. The code is publicly viewable for transparency and security review, but it is not open source. This prevents liquidity fragmentation - you can't deploy competing versions of Solid. However, anyone can use the ISolid interface to build contracts that interact with Solids, and anyone can use the deployed NOTHING contract to create tokens, ensuring all Solids share the same ecosystem and liquidity standards.
